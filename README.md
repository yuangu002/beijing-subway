Android App for foreign visitors to Beijing. 
Return the shortest path between any two subway stations. 
Allow multiple(flexible) definition on "shortest": Minimal time; # of transfers; # of sites along the way.

Use: for Android mobile user, use the app/release/app-release.apk

Future works:
1. Add Google Map API for accurate data (currently I use fake data based on experience)
2. Add more cities and more travel services and everything can help visitors exploring a new city
3. Combine the three priorities to get an optimized yet "compromised" path.
